# Advanced Character Controller in Unity

This repository contains a comprehensive example of an advanced character controller for 3D games in Unity. The controller includes various features such as smooth movement, sprinting, crouching, jumping (with double jump), interaction with objects, health system, and animations.

## Features

- Smooth and responsive movement with customizable speeds for walking, sprinting, and crouching.
- Jumping mechanics with the ability to perform a double jump.
- Interact with objects in the game world using the interaction key.
- Health system with damage-taking functionality and a die animation.
- Animator integration for seamless character animations.
- Ground check for accurate jumping detection.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the project in Unity.
3. Navigate to the `Assets/Scripts` folder to find the `AdvancedCharacterController.cs` script.
4. Attach the script to your player character GameObject.
5. Adjust the parameters in the script inspector to customize the character's behavior.
6. Ensure that your character model has an Animator component and create animations for walking, jumping, crouching, and dying.
7. Drag and drop the animations into the Animator controller.
8. Test your character's movement, jumping, interactions, and health system.

## Notes

- Make sure to configure your player's Rigidbody component for physics interactions.
- Feel free to modify the code to fit your specific game mechanics and requirements.
- For any questions or issues, please open an Issue in this repository.
